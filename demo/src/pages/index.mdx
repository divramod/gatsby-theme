# Gatsby Theme Candor (Demo)

<Image src={animTvSignalNoisy} />

Gatsby Theme Candor is a simple and honest theme that will help you set up a production-grade website in no time.

Out of the box, it provides support for Typescript, MDX, and a custom theme built using the `theme-ui` spec.
It also comes pre-configured to support a blog, frontmatter, syntax highlighting in code blocks, and responsive images.
